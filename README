Add To Pinboard
===============	


This script, coupled with Adium (http://adium.im) and the Pipe Event Plugin (http://jcs.org/notaweblog/2010/12/28/pipe_event_plugin_for_adium/) will add URLs found in messages to Pinboard.in (as long as you have a Pinboard account). It will add the title of the page, and add 2 tags - im and a tag for the user who sent the message.
